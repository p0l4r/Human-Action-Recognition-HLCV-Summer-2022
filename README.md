# Human Action Recognition - HLCV Summer 2022

Human Action Recognition - is our project for High-Level Computer Vision for  Summer Semester 2022. Our goal is to find a better-suited fine-tuned model for Human Action Recognition. We fine-tuned different pre-trained deep learning models and tried to measure their performance. 

## Dataset

## Hardware used to run the code

We used hardware support provided by Kaggle. If you open an account with Kaggle you can get 40 hours of GPU time. We took advantage of that.
