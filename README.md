# Human Action Recognition - HLCV Summer 2022

Human Action Recognition - is our project for High-Level Computer Vision for  Summer Semester 2022. 

In this work, we investigate and compare the overall performance of different renowned pre-trained deep learning models and their ensembles on the task of Human Action
Recognition. We use a publicly available image dataset found from Kaggle. The dataset is comprised of 15 different classes. We purposely used a small dataset to address
the overfitting issues with respect to other proposed models and tried to mitigate it using a deep ensemble technique.

## Dataset

## Hardware used to run the code

We used hardware support provided by Kaggle. If you open an account with Kaggle you can get 40 hours of GPU time. We took advantage of that.
